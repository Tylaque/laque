            <p>Cheers to a new year and another for us to get it right. Write it on your heart that every day is the best day in the year and no one owns the day who allows it to be invaded with anxiety. Finish every day and be done with it; we have done what we could. Some blunders no doubt crept in; forget them as soon as you can. Tomorrow is a new day; begin it well and serenely with too high a spirit to be cumbered with your old nonsense.</p>
